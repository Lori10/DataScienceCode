Train Test Split 
Dropping unnecessary columns
Handling Unwanted Values (we can treat them as missing values)
Handling Missing Values (they can be denoted as np.nan or ' ' or '?' etc)
Encoding Categorical Features
Handling Outliers (for example Gaussian Transformation)
Feature Selection [ A)Dropping constant features, B)Handling Multicolleniarity, C)Feature Selection ]
Feature Scaling

Note : after each step of feature engineering we must check that both training and test set have same columns
using : np.array_equal(X_train.columns, X_test.columns)
